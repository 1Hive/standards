## Notes

### UX

Most documentation is very boring and no one reads it. Anything that would make the docs/guides more interesting is going to be a huge win for us.
- custom formatting/themes: docs are formatted via the project's Docusaurus CSS/UI
- pictures/charts (what are some good resources to help people visually explain what their apps do?)
- live code examples (the Rust ecosystem really benefits from being able to embed live Rust examples in their docs)
