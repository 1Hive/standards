Part of the [mission of 1Hive](https://1hive.github.io/mvp/docs/welcome) is to create tools that make it easier for people to learn about, use, and build DAOs to empower their communities. As such, it makes sense that the 1Hive DAO Kit ships with basic docs, user onboarding guides, and templates for both. This standard documentation framework will be used to document all the apps used in the 1Hive DAO model. This will also include a doc creation guide that will help communities create new docs that are organized and informative as they extend and modify the DAO. 

Objective:
- A docs template that will ship with the 1Hive DAO Kit that will allow people to easily create documentation for their own apps/projects.
- Once created this docs template can be used to document new 1Hive apps.
- If successful, this docs template could potentially be expanded to improve documentation for apps across the Aragon ecosystem.
